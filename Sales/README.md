# 💼 Sales Performance Dashboard  
### 📊 *Analyzing Global Sales Trends to Drive Business Growth*

This dashboard project was developed as part of my internship at **Nextgen**, where I focused on analyzing company-wide sales data to uncover trends, top-performing regions, and product-level insights. The goal was to build a clear and interactive Power BI dashboard to help business teams monitor key performance indicators and make informed decisions.
