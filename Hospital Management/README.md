# 🏥 Hospital Performance Dashboard  
### 📊 *Visualizing Key Healthcare Metrics for Operational and Strategic Decisions*

This project was developed as part of my internship at **Nextgen**, where I built an interactive hospital performance dashboard using Power BI. The dashboard provides insights into patient demographics, department performance, treatment costs, and operational trends to support data-driven decisions in healthcare management.

## 🚀 Dashboard Overview

The Hospital Performance Dashboard offers a comprehensive view of hospital operations and patient outcomes. It highlights trends in inpatient vs outpatient care, department-wise costs, patient age distribution, and more — enabling administrators and care teams to improve service delivery and resource allocation.

## 🔍 Key Features & Visuals

### 📌 KPI Cards
- **Total Patients (IDs):** 1,751  
- **Total Inpatients:** 1,679  
- **Total Treatment Cost:** ₹287.60K  
- **Total Staff Involved:** 262  
- **Total Deaths:** 86  
- **Cost per Patient:** ~₹164  

📌 **Insight:** Moderate death rate (~4.9%). Inpatients dominate patient traffic.

📌 **Recommendation:**  
- Monitor death trends to improve critical care.  
- Conduct regular performance reviews for inpatient services.

---

### 📊 Age Distribution
- **Top Age Groups:** 6–20 and 41–60  
- Suggests youth injuries and middle-aged chronic conditions.

📌 **Recommendation:**  
- Focus on adolescent programs and middle-age wellness care.  
- Tailor preventive care services to high-volume groups.

---

### 📅 Weekday Analysis (Inpatient vs Outpatient)
- **Peak Days:** Thursday and Friday  
- **Outpatients consistently higher** across all days.

📌 **Recommendation:**  
- Use slot-based systems to evenly distribute appointments.  
- Allocate more resources for peak days.

---

### 🏷️ Patient Status Analysis
- **Top Statuses:** Normal > Readmit > Discharge > ICU > Death  
- High "Readmit" count indicates post-treatment gaps.

📌 **Recommendation:**  
- Improve discharge and post-care protocols.  
- Investigate reasons behind frequent readmissions.

---

### 🏥 Departmental Insights
- **Top Volume Departments:** Physical Medicine & Rehab, Surgery  
- **Top Cost Departments:**  
  - Cardiology (₹79.48K) – 27.64%  
  - Dermatology (₹66.86K) – 23.25%  
  - OT (₹38.14K) – 13.26%

📌 **Recommendation:**  
- Prioritize investment in high-performing departments.  
- Audit underutilized departments for service gaps.

---

### 🌍 Region-wise Analysis
- **Top Regions by Cost:**  
  - British Columbia (₹137.56K – 54.26%)  
  - California (15.33%)  
  - Washington (7.24%)

📌 **Recommendation:**  
- Audit high-cost regions.  
- Promote preventive care & telemedicine to reduce load.

---

### 🚻 Gender-wise Analysis
- **Males** dominate Cardiology and OT;  
- **Females** more frequent in Gynaecology and Dermatology.

📌 **Recommendation:**  
- Run gender-targeted awareness campaigns.  
- Ensure gender-sensitive care and policies.
